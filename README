Rich Media Backbone Services simple demo

This is a simple demo showing how one can create an ASP.NET webapp using the
RMC C# client. This demo is intentionally simple and serves just to show how to get 
assets into and out of drops.

To get started just open the project in Visual Studio and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your
api key in the file 'web.config'

Currently signing of requests is not implemented but it will be soon
